# calculator

This Project was a challenge as part of my Nology course, the aim was to create a functional web based calculator. The time allowance was 3 days.

I achieved this using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript and am fairly happy with the outcome. Two of the modifier buttons haven't been coded, I may in future come back to this and
incorporate these functions into this project but as of right now I'm happy with where it is at.

The most challenging part of this project was understanding how a to write a class and utilise functions within it, I could have used functional logic instead,
in hindsight doing so would likely have been easier for me but I'm still satisfied with how this is written and how it works.

It should run straight out of the box as long as you have VSCode installed to launch it from.
